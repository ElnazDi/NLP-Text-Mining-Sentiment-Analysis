## NLP-Text-Mining

In the following we can do text mining and sentiment analysis in python using Scikit-Learn to train the model with Random forest, making ba of the words...

## Main Concepts:
1. Lexical level
<ul>
  <li>Character (character n-grams and sequences)</li>
  <li>Words (Tokenization, Lower casing, Stop-words, stemming, lemmatization, Part of Speech)</li>
  <li>Phrases</li>
  <li>Taxonomies</li>
</ul>


2. Syntactic level
— Vector-space model (Bag of the Words | TF-IDF)
— Language Models
— Full-parsing
— Cross-modality


3. Semantic level
— Collaborative tagging
— Templates
— Ontologies
